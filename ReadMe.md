# **The Court Quiz** - A Milestone Project 

## Introduction

Hello & Welcome to my second Code Institute Milestone Project:
A Quiz website based around the book "A Court of Thorns and Roses" by Sarah J Maas; one of my all time favourite book series.

During my time learning JavaScript with Code Institute, I admit I have found it very challenging and a problem that seems to be just slightly out of reach.

This project will hopefully show a basic understanding of the knowledge I managed to gather during the weeks studying on my Full Stack Software Development Diploma with Code Institute; but it will also give an insight into the struggles I encountered during this time, with myself to be the first to admit that JavaScript is still a programming language that I do not feel confident writing in during the time of creating this project and ReadME.

However, that doesn't mean that I have given up - Merely that this is a stepping stone towards more hours spent tackling JavaScript projects from different angles and with the help of additional resources.

I will go into more detail below about the site and I thank you for taking the time to view this project.
